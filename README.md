# Fraud Detection in Credit Card Transactions

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data using anomaly detection algorithms. The models were trained without access to fraud labels, simulating a real-world scenario where fraud is rare and labels are delayed or unavailable.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is a widely referenced anonymized credit card transaction dataset with:
- 284,807 transactions
- 492 fraudulent transactions (~0.17%)
- 30 features (28 PCA-transformed, plus 'Time' and 'Amount')

---

## Objective

To detect anomalies in credit card transactions using:
- Isolation Forest
- Autoencoder Neural Network

And compare their performance in identifying fraud without using supervised labels.

---

## Approach

1. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and scaling.
2. Trained:
   - Isolation Forest (tree-based anomaly detection)
   - Autoencoder (deep learning-based reconstruction)
3. Compared models on Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
4. Visualized confusion matrices side-by-side.

## Key Results

| Model            | Precision (Fraud) | Recall (Fraud) | F1 Score |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| Isolation Forest | 25.77%           | 25.41%         | 25.59%   |
| Autoencoder      | 2.92%            | 84.55%         | 5.65%    |

- Isolation Forest is more conservative with fewer false positives.
- Autoencoder catches more fraud but flags more legitimate transactions.

---

## Takeaways

- Unsupervised models can detect fraud with minimal prior knowledge.
- Trade-offs between precision and recall must be tuned based on business impact.
- Ensemble methods could potentially combine the strengths of both.
